							<h1> What I Wish Life Was Like</h1>

							<p> Might I ask if you,<br>
								if you yearn for days you never had?<br>
								<br>
								Do you long for scents you never smelled?<br>
								And city lights you have never seen?<br>
								Memories that never were?<br>
								And a life of <br>
								<i>what could be?</i><br>
								<br>
								I wish to be someone else in a city,<br>
								a city that never sleeps.<br>
								Not New York,<br> 
								but a city<br>
								from my dreams.<br>
								<br>
								A city where people skip to work,<br>
								and where taxi men are happy just<i>to be</i>.<br>
								<br>
								A place where I am real,<br>
								a real thing, <br>
								not just a mere dream.<br>
								<br>
								Lights that twinkle from house to house,<br>
								neighbors who wave as they cross the streets.<br>
								Race causes no problems<br>
								and religion is smoking weed.<br>
								<br>
								Scents of autumn and scents of rain,<br>
								a sense of what could be.

						If ten years ago you asked, "Ava, are you a poet?" I would have laughed and continued to scroll on Tumblr. If you asked the same question 6 years ago, I'd probably look at you full of confusion. Funny how time works. 
						<br>

						<br>
						My freshman year of college I applied to write for The Odyssey Online. This was my first experience with non-academic writing. About four months later I quit because I came to the realization that the editors cared about producing content more than the content itself, and it was quite obvious to me that my writing was subpar since I never had time to really think about what I was publishing. I continued to explore writing through an academic lens, particularly in my Philosophy studies. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Some time in the midst of this, I came across a book called "The Romantic Poets." I didn't know much about poetry during this time, but I knew I enjoyed "relatable quotes." Truth be told, I got the book because the cover was just so beautiful. Not too long after this purchase, I began reading the book. The words were beautiful, and I had that same sort of feeling inside that I have when looking at conceptual photos. 
						<br>
						<br>
						At the start of my sophomore year of college I enrolled in poetry course so that I could learn more about poems and poets. I was in for a surprise. The emphasis of the class was to write and workshop your own poetry. Never had I written a poem before, except for a couple haikus in middle school. I completed my first writing assignment and I thought I did "okay." My professor, on the other hand, was really impressed with my work. I continued to write, and write, and write, carrying a book with me everywhere I went.
						<br>
						<br>
						It's been three years since that first class. Even now, in my graduate studies, I continue to take poetry classes at the university level. It did not take long for me to develop my own poetic voice, and it continues to evolve each day. Most of my poems tug at feelings of being intrigued, invincble, curious, and whole. I think my fondness of philosophical studies and photography have allowed me to excel at poetic writing. My writing is conceptual. It is unusual, it relatable, and it is powerful. My writing is me.
