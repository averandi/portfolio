				Hi, I'm Ava Randa, welcome to my portfolio of poetry. I have been fascinated by words since a young age. That sounds weird, doesn't it? Perhaps a better way to phrase that is, well, I've always been sensitive. The impact of verbal speech, song, or written word has made me feel tingly inside. I'm not one to forget something ridden with importance or emotion. Words often linger with me and I mull over their meaning.
				<br>
				<br>
				Are you still confused? Do you think I'm writing nonsense? Here, let's try again. Have you ever listened to a song where both the words and the beat make you want to play it over, and over, and over again? Or, have you ever looked at an image and suddenly feel a sense of peace from within? What about a book with no images... have you just looked at text but seen a whole world in your head?
				<br>
				<br>
				There we go. That's what I'm talking about. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I hundreds of original poems. but this site highlights 12 of my personal favorites. Once you've entered the portal to my imagination (the Poetry page on this website), I encourage you to hover and click on each poem so that the text is enlarged. More importantly, I hope you really read the words so that at least one of the 12 pieces resonates with you.
				<br>
				<br>
				xx Ava
