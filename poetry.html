And I love persistence, in small doses
for I don’t want to O.D.... but constant contact
leads me to my euphoria.
I’ve never understood the bitter burn of liquor
nor the sting of smoke that hurts the throat.
And I’ve never understood
not putting others first,
nor the idea of playing hard to get.
I’m addicted to the letters on my five inch screen and hot breath whispers
in my ear.
I like the fluttering in
my stomach when fingers
brush my body
and I like people and all the possibilities with them.
I like people, my drug.
Connecting is my cocaine."/>

I trudged through the rain
and walked over the melted snow only to sit
in a coffee shop’s disappointing chair.
The smell of the dark roast coffee is much better than the wormy aroma of the grey outdoors.
I’ve sipped the brown juice
and realized coffee is my favorite vice even though it no longer serves me well.
I’ve read a few messages,
even sent a few back,
yet I remain complacent
as I eye the glossy girl
who looks at me with a daring stare.
I told myself to do stuff today.
My heartbeat stays the same
while my mind wanders,
frantic,
fearful of the lack of limits
and the boundaries it does not have.
My body slowly shivers as the cold air escapes the city through the window
to visit me with a not-so-warm, “hello.” The cold hugs me with its frozen arms and while my body is chilled,
the rest of me remains unchanged
as I continue to inhale the barista’s art, the one that no longer affects me—
and I wonder:
how many coffees have I sipped
for me to have become this way, unaffected by nature’s greatest beast?
I suppose I’ve done something today, for I’ve done nothing"/>

I try not to rhyme rhymes, but I already did it so soon
As I fill these long lines with nonsense, I’m grateful for what I can do
But there I went again— placing another rhyme on the page
My teacher told me to not use ‘–i-n-g’, for it takes the beauty away
I look up and am thankful that I have long lines of things to say
The way the light casts a shadow on the table just gave me last thing to say I hope these words have made long lines
